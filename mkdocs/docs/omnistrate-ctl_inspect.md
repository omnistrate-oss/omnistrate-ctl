## omnistrate-ctl inspect

Interactive TUI to inspect Kubernetes resources

### Synopsis

This command provides an interactive Terminal UI to inspect resources in a Kubernetes namespace.
The command connects to a Kubernetes cluster using your kubeconfig file and displays resources
in the specified namespace. The instance-id parameter is used as the namespace name.

Three main views are provided:

1. Workload View - Shows StatefulSets and Deployments with their pods grouped by Availability Zone
2. Infrastructure View - Shows cluster infrastructure organized by Availability Zone, VMs, and pods
3. Storage View - Shows StatefulSets and Deployments with their pods, PVCs, and PVs in a hierarchy.
   Click on a PV to show a detailed pop-up with storage class information.

Navigation:

- TAB: Switch between views
- ↑/↓: Navigate through the tree
- ENTER: Expand/collapse nodes
- q: Quit the TUI

Connection to Kubernetes:

- Uses your local kubeconfig file (default: ~/.kube/config)
- Can specify alternate kubeconfig with --kubeconfig flag
- Can specify Kubernetes context with --context flag
