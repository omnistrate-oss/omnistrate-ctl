## omnistrate-ctl build

Build Services from image, compose spec or service plan spec

### Synopsis

Build command can be used to build a service from image, docker compose, and service plan spec.
It has two main modes of operation:

- Create a new service plan
- Update an existing service plan

Below info served as service plan identifiers:

- service name (--name, required)
- environment name (--environment, optional, default: Dev)
- environment type (--environment-type, optional, default: dev)
- service plan name (the name field of x-omnistrate-service-plan tag in compose spec file, required)
  If the identifiers match an existing service plan, it will update that plan. Otherwise, it'll create a new service plan.

This command has an interactive mode. In this mode, you can choose to promote the service plan to production by interacting with the prompts.

```
