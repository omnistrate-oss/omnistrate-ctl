## omnistrate-ctl build

Build Services from image, compose spec or service plan spec

### Synopsis

Build command can be used to build a service from image, docker compose, and service plan spec. 
It has two main modes of operation:
  - Create a new service plan
  - Update an existing service plan

Below info served as service plan identifiers:
  - service name (--product-name, required)
  - environment name (--environment, optional, default: Dev)
  - environment type (--environment-type, optional, default: dev)
  - service plan name (the name field of x-omnistrate-service-plan tag in compose spec file, required)
If the identifiers match an existing service plan, it will update that plan. Otherwise, it'll create a new service plan. 

This command has an interactive mode. In this mode, you can choose to promote the service plan to production by interacting with the prompts.

```
omnistrate-ctl build [--file=file] [--spec-type=spec-type] [--product-name=service-name] [--description=service-description] [--service-logo-url=service-logo-url] [--environment=environment-name] [--environment-type=environment-type] [--release] [--release-as-preferred] [--no-release-as-preferred] [--release-description=release-description][--interactive] [--image=image-url] [--image-registry-auth-username=username] [--image-registry-auth-password=password] [--env-var="key=var"] [flags]
```

omctl build --file compose.yaml --product-name "My Service" --environment prod --environment-type prod

# Build service with compose spec and release the service with a release description
omctl build --file compose.yaml --product-name "My Service" --release --release-description "v1.0.0-alpha"

# Build service with compose spec and release the service as preferred with a release description
omctl build --file compose.yaml --product-name "My Service" --release-as-preferred --release-description "v1.0.0-alpha"

# Build service with service specification for Helm, Operator or Kustomize as preferred
omctl build --spec-type ServicePlanSpec --file spec.yaml --product-name "My Service" --release-as-preferred --release-description "v1.0.0-alpha"

# Build service with service specification for Helm, Operator or Kustomize and explicitly do not release as preferred
omctl build --spec-type ServicePlanSpec --file spec.yaml --product-name "My Service" --no-release-as-preferred --release-description "v1.0.0-alpha"

# Build service from image in dev environment
omctl build --image docker.io/mysql:5.7 --product-name MySQL --env-var "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password" --env-var "MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb"

# Build service with private image in dev environment
omctl build --image docker.io/namespace/my-image:v1.2 --product-name "My Service" --image-registry-auth-username username --image-registry-auth-password password --env-var KEY1:VALUE1 --env-var KEY2:VALUE2

```

### Options

```

      --environment string           Name of the environment to build the service in (default "Dev")
      --environment-type string      Type of environment. Valid options include: 'dev', 'prod', 'qa', 'canary', 'staging', 'private') (default "dev")
  -f, --file string                  Path to the docker compose file (defaults to compose.yaml or spec.yaml)

      --release-as-preferred         Release the service as preferred after building it
      --release-description string   Used together with --release or --release-as-preferred flag. Provide a description for the release version
      --service-logo-url string      URL to the service logo
  -s, --spec-type string             Spec type (will infer from file if not provided). Valid options include: 'DockerCompose', 'ServicePlanSpec'
