## omnistrate-ctl build

Build one service plan from docker compose

### Synopsis

Build command can be used to build one service plan from docker compose. 
It has two main modes of operation:
  - Create a new service plan
  - Update an existing service plan

Below info served as service plan identifiers:
  - service name (--name, required)
  - environment name (--environment, optional, default: Dev)
  - environment type (--environment-type, optional, default: dev)
  - service plan name (the name field of x-omnistrate-service-plan tag in compose spec file, required)
If the identifiers match an existing service plan, it will update that plan. Otherwise, it'll create a new service plan. 

This command has an interactive mode. In this mode, you can choose to promote the service plan to production by interacting with the prompts.
